### About
<hr>

*This website was created as part of my course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=bing-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=BG-Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_term=_._ag_1219358808134939_._ad__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-76210237821084_._li_2484_._pd__._&utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy%2B_._&matchtype=e&msclkid=a8cb22e88b6e14c02a4b7d3f06cd0006">Udemy JavaScript Course</a>.*

*The purpose of it, is to inspire the users with quotes from important people who have inspired us with their actions. The main purpose of this site is not only to inspire but to motivate them.  This is my way of influencing people by using the magic of technology. I hope it will help and others by sharing the quote on Twitter.*

The site contains the following:

* Button where you make an asynchronous fetch request to REST API to get the quote.
* A loader that loads between quotes.
* And another button where it redirects you to your twitter acount and if you are already loggen in you can publish the quote on Twitter.

*The technologies we used to create the website are the follow:*

<a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/"> **HTML 5** </a> : Markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Email.html"> **CSS 3** </a>: Style the web documents

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">**JavaScript**</a>: used to program the behavior of Web pages.

*In order to get the quote, I followed the below steps:* 

* Call <a href="https://forismatic.com/en/api/">**Forismatic.com**</a> to get a random joke.
* Then we create a loader from  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp">**w3schools.com**</a>.
* In order to pblic the quote via Twitter we checked <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/guides/web-intent">**Twitter Integration Documentation**</a>.

*We took the hero image from:* <a href="https://www.heropatterns.com/">**Hero Patterns**</a>
*We took the icons from:* <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&q=close&m=free">**Font Awesome**</a>
